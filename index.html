		<h3>About me</h3>
		<p>Hi,</p>
		<p>My name is Mouakong Brandon Xiong! I usually go by Brandon my middle name since it is easier to pronounce but since this is the internet it doesn't matter that much right?</p>
		<p>I like to watch alot of movies and animes especially anything that has to do with Star Wars!!!! I also enjoy spending time with my family and friends!</p>
		<p>Currently I am a full time worker at Advanced Circuits doing CAM/CAD (Computer Aided Manufacturing/Draft) work and going to school on the side to get my B.S. in Computer Science. I am also learning Web Development and Machine Learning side to side too to make progress in achieving my goals.</p>
		<p>My two big goals are to contribute to space exploration through coding and I would also like to help young children struggling at home with nothing to do after school through after school programs to help them succeed in both school and life.</p>
